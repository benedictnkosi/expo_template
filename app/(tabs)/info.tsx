    question: "How does ExamQuiz work?",
    answer: "ExamQuiz helps you practice with real past exam questions. Choose your subjects, select Paper 1 or Paper 2, and start practicing! Each question comes with detailed solutions and explanations. Your progress is tracked separately for each paper and subject."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between Paper 1 and Paper 2?",
    answer: "Each subject is divided into Paper 1 and Paper 2, following the official exam structure. Each paper covers different topics and sections of the curriculum. You can practice both papers separately to ensure complete preparation."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI help me learn?",
    answer: "Our AI assistant helps explain concepts in detail when you get a question wrong. It breaks down the solution step-by-step, identifies where you might have gone wrong, and provides additional examples to help you understand."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I select my curriculum and terms?",
    answer: "In your profile settings, you can choose between CAPS and IEB curricula or both, and select which terms (1-4) you want to see questions from. This helps customize your practice to match your school's curriculum and current term."
  },
  {
    question: "How do streaks work?",
    answer: "To maintain your daily streak, you need to get at least 3 correct answers each day. Miss a day or fail to get 3 correct answers, and your streak resets. Keep practicing daily to build your streak! ðŸ”¥"
  },
  {
    question: "How do points work?",
    answer: "You earn 1 point for each correct answer. Get on a roll with 3 correct answers in a row, and you'll earn double points for your next correct answers! Keep the streak going to maximize your points. ðŸŽ¯"
  },
  {
    question: "How does the progress tracking work?",
    answer: "Each subject shows your performance with:\nâ€¢ Total questions attempted\nâ€¢ Correct answers (Bullseyes)\nâ€¢ Incorrect answers (Oopsies)\nâ€¢ Overall mastery percentage\nThe progress bar color indicates your performance level: green for high scores, amber for medium, and red for areas needing improvement."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change my grade or school?",
    answer: "Yes, you can update your grade and school in the profile section. Note that changing your grade will reset your progress as questions are grade-specific. Your school information helps us provide relevant curriculum content."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I find an issue with a question?",
    answer: "You can report any issues with questions using the report button in the quiz screen. Our team will review and address the reported issues to ensure accuracy."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I reset my progress?",
    answer: "You can reset your progress for individual subjects from the subject screen. This will clear your progress for that specific subject and let you start fresh."
